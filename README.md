- Open terminal
- Type `npm install`

## Setup

In `server` directory you will need to create a `datasources.json` file that will be used to reference the source of data for Loopback.

Contact the project maintainer to learn more.

## Quick Start

Run the following command to start the REST API.

```
$ npm run start
```

Run the following command to run the linter.

## Alternative setup for MS Windows (Works on Linux and Mac also)

It comes with Node.js support out of the box.
