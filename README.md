# treetracker-admin-api

  >  TreeTracker's Admin Panel RESTful API built with loopback.

## Requirements

- Install Node
   - on OSX, install [home brew](http://brew.sh/) and type `brew install node`
   - on Windows, use the installer available at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)
   - On OSX you can alleviate the need to run as sudo by [following John Papa's instructions](http://jpapa.me/nomoresudo)
- Open terminal
- Type `npm install`

## Quick Start

Run the following command to start the REST API.

```
$ npm run start
```

Run the following command to run the linter.

$ npm run lint
```

## Alternative setup for MS Windows (Works on Linux and Mac also)
On Windows the easiest way to develop and debug Node.js applications is using Visual Studio Code.
It comes with Node.js support out of the box.
